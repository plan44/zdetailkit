ZDetailKit was born out of the need to generate editors for complex object in my tasks and calendaring apps Continuous, EverTaskZ, Tasks+Cal+Sync, SyncML PRO,  and SyncML LITE.

Features to mention

- ZUtils as separate, independent utilities
- ZCustomI8n
- Valueconnectors as generic component
- ZDateTimeCell with all the extended options (suggestion, start/end, masterdate etc.)
- choice manager as mostly generic component
